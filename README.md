# 05-ucd-challenge

In this repository there will be a deployed website. 

Inside this deployed website will be a calendar. 

The calendar marks the current date and time. 

The calendar also highlights the current time with the color red and the remaining time of the day with the color green.

You are also able to save events at the times you need to save them and they will stay even if the page is refreshed. 

Here is the deployed website link: https://alecworthen.github.io/05-ucd-challenge/
